# local-weather-app

A web app to show weather condition of user's location. The app uses ip-api.com API to get user's coordinates.
Then the app uses openweathermap API to get weather's condition bases on latitude and longitude.

Earlier I used geolocation feature of browser to get user's coordinates but the browser asked confirmation everytim I ran it. Therefore it led to slow loading of web app.

Here is screenshot of working of app  :-
